# Development Lessons

## What Made This Work (Previous Attempt Failed)

**UI Shell First** - Built working interface with fake data before touching Word COM
- 45 minutes to get clicking buttons and realistic output
- Could test user workflow without debugging COM issues
- Gave confidence the approach was right

**Simple Classes** - 5 focused classes instead of enterprise architecture  
- MainForm, WordManager, FileManager, ImportTracker, Logger
- Each does one thing well
- Easy to debug when something breaks

**Fix Errors Immediately** - Never let code stay broken
- Each commit compiled and ran
- Small iterative fixes for COM API issues
- Avoided debugging multiple problems at once

**Learn APIs Incrementally** - COM interop through trial and error
- Started with basic calls, built up complexity
- Each failure taught us the right pattern
- `foreach` â†’ indexed loops, casting, proper disposal

## Key Insights

**Word COM Quirks:**
- Use `template.BuildingBlockEntries` not `document.BuildingBlockEntries`
- Cast `get_AttachedTemplate()` to `(Word.Template)`
- Use `for` loops with `.Item(i)` instead of `foreach`
- Always dispose COM objects properly

**Development Order:**
1. UI shell with placeholders
2. Core business classes  
3. Real integration
4. Error handling and polish

## Time: 4 Hours vs. Previous Multi-Day Failure

The UI-first approach prevented the architectural confusion that killed the previous attempt.
