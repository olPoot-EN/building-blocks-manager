# SIMPLE BUILD - Use Traditional .NET Framework Project

The SDK-style project is causing too many COM interop issues. Use the traditional project instead:

## Quick Build Steps

1. **Use the Traditional Project:**
   ```powershell
   # Build the Framework project instead
   msbuild BuildingBlocksManager.Framework.csproj /p:Configuration=Release
   ```

2. **Or Open in Visual Studio:**
   - Open `BuildingBlocksManager.Framework.csproj` directly
   - This avoids all the SDK-style project issues

## Why This Works Better

- Traditional .NET Framework project structure
- Direct COM interop references
- No modern C# language issues
- Standard Windows Forms approach

## Alternative: Minimal COM Approach

If COM interop is still problematic, we can:

1. **Remove COM Dependency Entirely**
2. **Use OpenXML SDK Instead** - manipulate Word documents directly
3. **Create a PowerShell Script** - let PowerShell handle Word automation
4. **Use Word VBA** - embed the logic directly in templates

## Recommendation

**Stop fighting the tooling!** Let's build a simpler version that actually works:

- Use OpenXML SDK to read/write .docx files directly
- Skip the Word COM automation entirely
- Focus on the file management logic (which works fine)

This eliminates ALL Word COM issues and makes it portable to any Windows machine without requiring Word to be installed.
